## Modelling of Naturally Fractured Reservoir
Here we will explain the modeling of naturally fractured reservoirs in simple words.

### NFRs models:

1- Continuum models

    1.1. Dual porosity single permeability 
    
    1.2. dual porosity dual permeability

2- Equivalent medium model

3- Discrete medium model:
  
    3.1. Discrete fracture network models (DFNs)
    
    3.2. Embedded discrete fracture network models (EDFM)

The following table from (Poli et al. 2024)
